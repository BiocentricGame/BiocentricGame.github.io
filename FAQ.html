				<h1>FAQ</h1>
				<h3>What exactly the number ‘4E6’ represent?</h3>
				<p>
					In the Strength's graph the value of 4E6 (in scientific notation) is an historical reference at the certainty of the Boson.
					The Strength's graph represents the Fisher meta-analysis, for artistic reasons it displays the inverse value of the result of the calculation.
					So the value of 4E6 is corresponding to a Fisher of 0,00000025.
					<br>
					At the beginning (1925) of the science of "statistical hypothesis testing", Fisher suggested the value of 0.05 as a significant level.
					Despite his initial suggestion of 0.05 as a significance level, Fisher did not intend this cutoff value to be fixed.
					In fact during the years the level has changed many times, furthermore it is different depending on the field of study.
					<br>
					For the 'statistical test suite' of the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (the methods used inside Biocentric Game), the level of statistical significance of non randomness is 1% (0,01).
					In social sciences today the optimum level is fixed at 0.001.
					It is to be noted that lower values are more significant and harder to obtain.
					<br>
					In specific fields such as particle physics and manufacturing, statistical significance is often expressed in multiples of the standard
					deviation or sigma (σ) of a normal distribution, with significance thresholds set at a much stricter level (e.g. 5σ).
					For instance, the certainty of the Higgs boson particle's existence was based on the 5σ criterion, which corresponds to a
					p-value of about 1 in 3.5 million, that in decimal notation is corresponding to 0,000000285714285714286.
					<br>
					In the simulation, when the Strength's graph reaches a level that is equal or more significant than the Boson's certainty, it always shows the same fixed label '4E6'.
					<br>
					At the end of the game, do we need more certainty than physicists?
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information on statistical significance visit: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance</a>
				</p>
				<h3>I see many labels ‘4E6’, but the values are at very different heights, what does it means?</h3>
				<p>
					For the reason explained above, in the Strength's graph the maximum value displayed in scientific notation is 4E6.
					<br>
					So when the graph displays more than one label '4E6', the ones positioned on the Y axis at higher heights are far more significant than
					a Fisher of 0,00000025, taking into account also the fact that the Y scale is logarithmic.
				</p>
				<h3>How can I know the exact value of the Fisher that has been obtained?</h3>
				<p>
					Biocentric Game can store complete information, either of games or blind-checks, using your Dropbox account (if you don't already have one you can create it for free).
					You can link the App to your Dropbox account from the main menu.
					After you have done this, you will obtain a file containing complete information for every run of the simulation (in JSON format).
					<br>
					The information include every bits of every sequences, with the relative statistical analysis performed with the 'statistical test suite' of the NIST, plus the values
					obtained by the meta-analysis.
					You can access the Dropbox folder on any desktop computer that you have linked to your Dropbox account.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information on the 'statistical test suite' visit: <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html</a>
					<br>
					For more information on the Dropbox service visit: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">https://www.dropbox.com</a>
				</p>
				<h3>How is the average computed in the graphs?</h3>
				<p>
					During the simulation it is processed a random sequence of 128 bits every 0.25 seconds.
					It is to be noted that this frequency (a sequence every 0.25 seconds) can vary depending on the conditions of the network connections, and in many cases it is lower.
					For example a two minutes game, in optimal conditions, might process up to 480 sequences.
					<br>
					This quantity of values is too great in order to be displayed in a graph visualized on a smartphone or on a tablet.
					As a consequence for the graphs only a subset of the received values is considered, up to a maximum of 150.
					<br>
					This quantity of 150 has been chosen upon testing, and its purpose is only to produce decorative graphs.
					The average displayed on top of the graphs is calculated on the subset, and again its purpose is merely decorative.
					<br>
					It might appear to you that the value of the average that has been calculated is too low, but you must remember that the
					Y axis is on a logarithmic scale, and typically the initial values of 'Strength' are very very low.
					<br>
					If you need to analyse in a scientific manner the results you can use the Dropbox functionality as explained above.
				</p>
				<h3>How is the 'Strength' correlated to the game engine?</h3>
				<p>
					Actually the 'Strength' is not directly correlated to the game engine.
					<br>
					In Biocentric Game the quantity of 'Coherence' is determined by two statistical measurements.
					The p-value of every single sequence increases the quantity of 'Coherence', meanwhile the cumulative effect size
					(of all the sequences computed up to the current one) determines of long the 'Coherence' will last, its tenacity.
					<br>
					The 'Strength' is merely informative in respect to the gameplay, but in scientific terms it means how far from the randomness you have gone.
				</p>
				<h3>Why is so much harder to win at higher levels of 'Frequency'?</h3>
				<p>
					When you raise the 'Frequency' in the game settings, you are determining the fact that inside the game much more sequences will be discarded and will not increase the 'Coherence'.
					If you choose a level of 20, only sequences with a p-value lower than 0.05 (more significant) will increase the 'Coherence'.
					<br>
					Instead if you choose a level of 50, the 'Coherence' will increase only when you receive a sequence with a p-value lower than 0.02 (it is 1/50).
					<br>
					Obviously in this second case you should expect to have much less advantages in the game.
				</p>
				<h3>I understand, but I still think that it is too hard to win with an higher 'Frequency'.</h3>
				<p>
					In fact when you raise the 'Frequency' you may notice that the Strength's graph produces very lower values.
					This is an unexpected result that is probably shown for the first time.
					<br>
					During the development phase there were many problems when trying to fine-tune the difficulty levels of the game, because
					it was always becoming too much difficult too rapidly.
					<br>
					Then it arose the idea of adding the calculation of the Fisher, to try to identify the problem.
					<br>
					At that point, with great surprise, it was shown that the problem was not inside the game engine.
					To say it in simple words, when you raise the 'Frequency' the source of entropy is collaborating with you, returning towards the randomness and making the game even harder.
				</p>
				<h3>How do you explain that the source of entropy is collaborating to the game?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm looking for the explanation, together with my partners, because we really need to win a Nobel prize.
					<br>
					In the meantime, it can be said that probably it is the new approach that has been adopted is at the origin of some unexpected results.
					This new approach consists in the fact that, for the first time in this kind of experiments, the operator has a choice of determining his
					own level of judgement of the statistical results.
					<br>
					In the past instead these tests were always performed by initially fixing the levels, typically 0.05 for the significance and 0.2 for the effect size.
					<br>
					Let's say, as an hypothesis, that the freedom of choice leverages the 'conscious observer'.
					<br>
					And it appears that there is a difference among the 'traditional observer' (i.e. the 'Double Slit' experiment) and the 'conscious observer'.
				</p>
				<h3>Are you really saying that the human consciousness is influencing the randomness?</h3>
				<p>
					By a scientific standpoint, Biocentric Game is showing that a random number generator is skewed when you play the game, meanwhile it is functioning
					normally when you run the blind check.
					<br>
					This is it.
					<br>
					If you like the idea that the human consciousness is influencing the source, you have a good argument that is supporting your hypothesis, but please note that this is not a final demonstration.
				</p>
				<h3>I'm still not convinced of what’s happening here.</h3>
				<p>
					The source code is online at the following link:
					<br>
					<a href="https://github.com/BiocentricGame/Biocentric-Game-rel-1.0.1">https://github.com/BiocentricGame/Biocentric-Game-rel-1.0.1</a>
					<br>
					Please note that the source code is protected by the copyright's laws, and also that the methods used for correlating the randomness to the gameplay are currently patent pending.
					<br>
					Anyway you can freely inspect the code, compile it and run for personal use.
				</p>
				<h3>I can't read the source code, can you explain how the randomness is evaluated?</h3>
				<p>
					A sequence is far from the randomness when it is rare, something like a winning ticket in a lottery.
					We are using sequences of 128 bits, so there are in total 340282366920938000000000000000000000000 possible different sequences (2^128).
					Now let's take as an example the fundamental 'Monobit' test of the ‘NIST test suite’ (the suite it is the reference in this matter).
					<br>
					The Monobit tests the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence, and its purpose it to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a
					sequence are approximately the same as would be expected for a truly random sequence.
					A couple of extremely rare sequences are '11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111'
					and '00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
					because they both appear only once out of the total possible sequences.
					<br>
					Their rarity is defined as a number, this number is obtained dividing their frequency of distribution by the total number of possibilities, in our case it is 1/2^128.
					This number is called the 'p-value', and in our example the p-value of the extremely rare sequences is 2.94E-39, or 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000293873587705572.
					<br>
					Instead a sequence is not rare when the number of zeroes and ones is roughly the same.
					In this case the p-value will go towards a value of 1, and the sequence is considered truly random.
					<br>
					In Biocentric Game the minimum required level of rarity is the 'Frequency' of 20, it means that a sequence is considered far from randomness
					when it could happen only once out of twenty (its p-value is equal or below 0.05, because it is calculated as 1/20).
					The challenge is to receive a greater quantity of rare sequences than the quantity normally expected.
					<br>
					A two minutes game normally evaluates up to 480 sequences, if you are playing at a  'Frequency' of 20 you normally expect to receive 24 (480/20) valid sequences.
					<br>
					And if you receive the quantity normally expected you loose, for sure, no escape.
					<br>
					You need to receive a much greater number of valid sequences, you need to bring the random number generator out of the randomness.
					The NIST test suite includes many more test of randomness, Biocentric Game incorporates many of them, they are detailed in the 'Background' page of this website.
				</p>
				<h3>I can't read the source code, what are the rules for calculating the 'Coherence" in the game, explain the 'Frequency' and the 'Strength'?</h3>
				<p>
					Let's suppose that you choose a 'Frequency' of 20 at the beginning of a game.
					With true randomness this should cause about one sequence out of twenty to increase the quantity of 'Coherence', as explained above.
					<br>
					Now imagine that you receive a sequence that could happen only once every one hundred times, in Biocentric Game this is defined as its 'Strength'
					and in this case the value is 100.
					Because this value is above the 'Frequency' we have the right to increase our 'Coherence', it happens as described in the following.
					<br>
					The difference among this 'Strength' and the 'Frequency' is calculated, so we obtain a value of 80 (100 - 20).
					At this point a logarithmic scale is applied to the found value (2 is the base), and the final result of this calculation is '6.32'.
					<br>
					Congratulations you just added 6.32 points to your 'Coherence'!
					<br>
					But remember, it will last for long only if you have a good 'Rank'.
				</p>
				<h3>What about the 'Amplitude' and the 'Rank' instead?</h3>
				<p>
					When you start to playing Biocentric Game you are forced to a single 'Amplitude' of 20, you can go at higher levels only if you win at the maximum 'Frequency' of 128.
					<br>
					The 'Amplitude', in our case, is the magnitude of the phenomenon of non-randomness, in statistical terms it is known as the 'effect size',
					and it is complementary to the statistical hypothesis testing (in our case the tests of non-randomness).
					To say it in simple terms, the measurement of the effect-size validates further the statistical results obtained in the tests of 'Strength' described above.
					<br>
					In Biocentric Game the 'Amplitude' is your choice, your challenge, and the 'Rank' is the reality of what you obtain.
					You typically need to reach a 'Rank' that is not too lower than the 'Amplitude' in order to win.
					<br>
					The manner in which this model is applied to the quantity of the 'Coherence' is similar to the one described above for the 'Frequency' and the 'Strength'.
					First the difference among the 'Amplitude' chosen and the current 'Rank' is calculated, then a logarithmic scale is
					applied to the found value, when the ‘Rank’ is below the ‘Amplitude’.
					<br>
					This value is a penalisation.
					<br>
					The 'Coherence' decreases with the passing of time, if you incur in the penalisation the 'Coherence' decreases even more, you loose it faster.
					<br>
					On the contrary if the 'Rank' is above the 'Amplitude' you have a prize, the time passing will not decrease too much the 'Coherence' or even,
					if your 'Rank' is really high, the 'Coherence' will cease to decrease entirely.
					In fact when the 'Rank' is above the 'Amplitude' to their difference is applied an exponential scale.
					<br>
					In Biocentric Game the calculation of the effect-size is done by using the Glass' Δ method.
				</p>
				<h3>Why the random number generators should be actually random?</h3>
				<p>
					In Biocentric Game you can choose among the local RNG and the ANU Quantum Random Server.
					Both they should be random because they are a measurement of physical processes with an high level of "entropy" and generally, "entropy" stands for "disorder" or uncertainty.<br>
					The local RNG on an iPhone is <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140sp/140sp1944.pdf">certified by the NIST</a> as being "FIPS 140-2" (compliant for Cryptographic application), and it acquire entropy from all standard inputs 
					like accelerometers, compass, radio baseband, as well as from certain parts of the circuitry which picks up interference at all levels.
					This certification is at the core of the security in the forthcoming ApplePay's method of payment.<br>
					Instead the ANU acquire entropy by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum, and quantum mechanics predicts that it will be random.
					On their website, in the <a href="http://qrng.anu.edu.au/FAQ.php">FAQ section</a>, it is written:<br>
					"If we can find some patterns in the numbers then physicist would have to work on a better theory to explain what is going on.”<br>
					I love physicists, and I hope they are going to have very interesting times.
