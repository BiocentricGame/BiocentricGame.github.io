				<h2>Revising 'The Game of Life'</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					Biocentric Game is freely inspired to the Conway's Game of Life, the cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
					This classic is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is only determined by an initial state, requiring no further input by the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Biocentric Game instead you have to manage some dynamic entities called Emoticells because they have a mood, and their mood depends by the state of the simulation, their world.
					In Biocentric Game the game state is influenced by the variations toward 'Chaos' or ‘Coherence’.</br>
					During the simulation many sequences of RNG's data are acquired and analysed to determine, according to well known statistical principles, their effective grade of randomness or,
					on the contrary, their grade of 'Coherence' (lack of randomness).</br>
					Because of that you will have two different situation: a 'Chaos' state that is determined by sequences of random data being measured really as random,
					and a second state named 'Coherence', this second state determined by the fact that the ‘expected’ random data are not actually random,
					according to the sets of measurements that are used.
				</p>

				<h4> The state of 'Chaos' determines many penalisation:</h4>
				<p>
					<ul class="disc">
						<li>
							Emoticells acquire nutrition slowly
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells die of overpopulation
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells can’t add to tissue (and you can never win)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>The state of 'Coherence' determines many advantages </h4>
				<p>
					that bring rapidly to a victory condition:</br>
					<ul class="disc">
						<li>
							Emoticells grow up and acquire nutrition rapidly
						</li>
						<li>
							there is no any problem of overpopulation
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells can form tissue and you can reach the victory!
						</li>
					</ul>

					The scene of the game accurately represents and notifies you about what is the state currently being enforced, enabling your
					Consciousness into the keeping of the 'Coherence' state as an incentive to the positive result of the simulation.</br>
					Biocentric Game provides both positive and negative forms of feedback, according to the valence of the action or effect that alters the states.</br>
					The feedback that is provided by the simulation has both informational and motivational purposes, and also both a qualitative and a quantitative component.

					In the upper part of the screen you can see the current game state, either of Chaos or Coherence state.</br>
					Just under the game state, on the left high portion of the screen, you see a scatter plot that is displaying the real time monitoring of the randomness source.
					The dotted line, that appears of yellow colour during a coherence, represents the level above which the source is not anymore  providing randomness.
					Instead when the plot is under the line, the source is providing true randomness because you are not operating the entanglement.

				</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="large-12 columns">
				<p>
					For the most performant devices, in the bottom left corner of the screen is displayed a line chart, this second plot is summarising
					the overall level of entanglement that you are providing in the simulation, it also represents the significance of your action in statistical terms.</br>
					The red coloured horizontal line of the bottom left plot is the zero level, meanwhile the orange coloured horizontal line is the limit of the randomness.
					When the plot is inside the perimeter defined by the red and the orange line, there is true randomness in the entropy’s source.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you are able to provide the entanglement, the plot goes higher than the orange line, this time it means that the source is not providing randomness anymore.
					In this significance plot, the yellow coloured horizontal line is the value of the Frequency that you choose before starting the simulation.

				<p>
					The third plot in the bottom right corner of the screen represents the magnitude of the entanglement you are providing.
					It has the same coloured lines as the significance plot, but with different meanings.</br>
					When the plot is inside the perimeter defined by the red and the orange lines, the magnitude is of low level.
					When the plot is above the orange line, the magnitude of the entanglement you are providing is at an higher level.
					In this magnitude plot the yellow dotted line is representing the amplitude values that you choose in the game settings.
