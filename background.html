				<p>
					Biocentric Game reports measurements of the effects of the interaction among Consciousness and physical processes,
					and utilise this process as a precise instrument to rapidly and accurately feed back information to the user.
					The simulation is rich of archetypes inspired by the traditions of the videogames, the links driving the player towards
					influencing the target are already put in place since the beginning, they are the foundation of the process.
					In our intentions, the consciousness of the user (if he has experience with videogames) can't avoid to provide the effect.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>The Design</h2>
				<p>
					At the high level, the flow of the application is the following:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Let the user select the level of difficulty and start the game by configuring the parameters of the simulation.
							The two main parameters are called 'Frequency' (it is related to the statistical significance) and 'Amplitude' (it is related to the statistical effect size).
						</li>
						<li>
							Start the simulation and acquire (in continuos) the random data from the RNG (remote or local).
							The largest quantity of tests have been produced, until now, by using the <a href="http://qrng.anu.edu.au" target="_blank">ANU Quantum Random Numbers Server</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Cache the data in a queue in time order in respect of the requesting time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Extract, from the queue, a sequence of random data using a criteria of an 'observation window'.
							For example, the bits that arrived not more later than 4 secs. ago, but not earlier than 2 secs. ago (these are additional configurable parameters).
						</li>
						<li>
							Perform a statistical analysis on the sequence to determine its actual randomness (its p-value).
							The <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/index.html" target="_blank">statistical test suite of the NIST</a> has been incorporated inside the code.
						</li>
						<li>
							Create an array containing this sequence together with all the other sequences previously arrived, and perform a meta-analysis on the array,
							measuring the statistical significance and the effect-size.
						</li>
						<li>
							Perform a correlation with the values of the analysis and the game engine, wherein positive values (in respect to the configured 'Frequency'
							and 'Amplitude') produce advantages to the gameplay meanwhile, on the contrary, the negative values provide detriment.
						</li>
						<li>
							Provide feedback to the user of both the statistical analysis and the meta-analysis.
						</li>
						<li>
							Update the simulation until it reaches a final condition of either win or lose.
						</li>
					</ol>

					Investigations of mind-matter interaction, using controlled methods in laboratories by qualified scientists, have reached todays a significant volume.
					Targets of these studies can be both 'Micro-PK' (microscopic dimension) and 'Macro-PK' targets (visible to a naked eye).
					<br>
					One example of a scientific publication related to the 'Micro-PK' field of investigation was originated by neuroscientist Lawrence Farwell and physicist George Farwell,
					their study reports (pages 956-957):
					<blockquote>
						“We investigated the possible effect of human consciousness and intention on a quantum-mechanical process. The experimental apparatus consisted of a small
						natural alpha-particle source, a solid-state particle detector, amplifiers, a single-channel analyser and pulse shaper, an oscilloscope, and a computer
						with digitiser board.
						<br>
						Count rates of about 1 kHz were observed, and the intervals (in [microseconds]) between successive alpha-decay events were sensed and recorded.
						Without outside influence, one predicts 50% even and 50% odd time intervals for successive particle detections.
						<br>
						Acting over a succession of 10-[second] intervals randomly assigned to the 3 below conditions, the 23 experiments, all experienced in achieving advanced state
						of consciousness, attempted to influence the decay process so as to yield
						<br>
						(1) an excess of intervals of an even number of [microseconds] (“even events”);
						<br>
						(2) an excess of “odds events”; or (3) either (control condition).
						<br>
						In 11,721,660 events in the “even” and “odd” conditions, we observed a total excess of 12,176 in the intended direction (i.e. “even” where intended and “odd” where intended),
						[associated with odds against chance of 5,000 to 1]. (In the control condition the number of “even” and “odd” events were statistically indistinguishable).”
						<br>
						<cite>Farwell, Lawrence A.; Farwell, George W. (April 1995), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Farwell#cite_note-Physics-16" target="_blank">"Quantum-Mechanical Processes and Consciousness", Bulletin of the American Physical Society 40 (2): 956–957.</a></cite>
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
					Many hundreds of similar experiments have been developed over the past half century, involving random number generator devices (RNGs).
					RNGs may be defined as follows:
					<blockquote>
						"A random number generator (RNG) is a computational or physical device designed to generate a sequence of numbers or symbols that lack any pattern, i.e. appear random.
						<br>
						…
						A physical random number generator can be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose unpredictability can be traced
						to the laws of quantum mechanics. Sources of entropy include radioactive decay, thermal noise, shot noise, avalanche noise in Zener diodes,
						clock drift, the timing of actual movements of a hard disk read/write head, and radio noise. However, physical phenomena and tools used to measure
						them generally feature asymmetries and systematic biases that make their outcomes not uniformly random.
						A randomness extractor, such as a cryptographic hash function, can be used to approach a uniform distribution of bits from a non-uniformly random source,
						though at a lower bit rate.”
						<cite>source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation</a></cite>
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
					These sort of experiments are conducted by asking the participants to influence the generation of sequences of random bits sourced by RNGs,
					wherein the influence can be measured by statistical analysis of the effective randomness of the sequences.
					<br>
					Several meta-analysis summarising the combined results are available, and the matter is highly debated among researchers.
					For example a recent meta-analysis by Hoger Bösch (and others), published in 2006 in the journal "Psychological Bulletin" is reporting that:
					<blockquote>
						"Seance-room and other large-scale psychokinetic phenomena have fascinated humankind for decades.
						Experimental research has reduced these phenomena to attempts to influence (a) the fall of dice and, later, (b) the output of random number generators (RNGs).
						<br>
						The meta-analysis combined 380 studies that assessed whether RNG output correlated with human intention and found a significant but very small overall effect size.
						The study effect sizes were strongly and inversely related to sample size and were extremely heterogeneous.
						<br>
						A Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the small effect size, the relation between sample size and effect size, and the extreme effect size heterogeneity
						found could in principle be a result of publication bias."
						<cite><a href="http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ742350" target="_blank">"Examining Psychokinesis:
							The Interaction of Human Intention with Random Number Generators--A Meta-Analysis" </a> (Psychological Bulletin, v132 n4 p497-523 Jul 2006)</cite>
					</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p>
					This study has been successively re-examined by another one, also published in the Psychological Bulletin, authored by Radin D, Nelson R, Dobyns Y, Houtkooper J.
					The title of the study is "Reexamining psychokinesis: comment on Bösch, Steinkamp, and Boller (2006)",
					and the abstract reports:
					<blockquote>
						"H. Bösch, F. Steinkamp, and E. Boller's review of the evidence for psychokinesis confirms many of the authors' earlier findings.
						The authors agree with Bösch et al. that existing studies provide statistical evidence for psychokinesis, that the evidence is generally of high methodological quality,
						and that effect sizes are distributed heterogeneously.
						Bösch et al. postulated the heterogeneity is attributable to selective reporting and thus that psychokinesis is "not proven."
						However, Bösch et al. assumed that effect size is entirely independent of sample size. For these experiments, this assumption is incorrect; it also guarantees heterogeneity.
						The authors maintain that selective reporting is an implausible explanation for the observed data and hence that these studies provide evidence for a genuine psychokinetic effect.

					Moreover Radin emphasises, in his recent book <a href="http://www.deanradin.com/supernormal.htm" target="_blank">Supernormal</a>, the importance of practicing the intention-focusing, and also the importance of
					giving to the participants a feedback (i.e. a meaningful bonus) of the outcomes of the results.
					<br>
					Here is a report of the aforementioned study by Radin D. et al. :
					<blockquote>
						“[Imagine] that we conduct a study involving 1,000 experienced meditators, each of whom is selected on the basis of his or her performance on a previous,
						similar [psychokinesis] task. Each participant is asked by a cordial, enthusiastic investigator to engage in a daily intention-focusing practice
						for 4 weeks in preparation for the experiment, in which he or she will be asked to intentionally influence the generation of a single random bit.
						<br>
						Participants are told that the outcome of that random decision will determine the outcome of a meaningful bonus, such as winning a scholarship.
						<br>
						Now consider a second study in which a bored student investigator indifferently recruits an arbitrarily selected college sophomore,
						who is asked to mentally influence 1,000 random bits generated in a millisecond, with no feedback of the results an no consequences regardless of the outcome.
						<br>
						The physical context of these two studies may be identical, using the same [random number generator] and statistics to evaluate the resulting data sets,
						each of which consists of a total of 1,000 randomly generated bits.
						<br>
						But it is clear that the psychological contexts differ radically. If we presume that the only important factor in this type of experiment is
						the number of bits generated, then the two studies should provide about the same results.
						<br>
						But if a significant variable is the amount of time or effort one can apply in focusing mental intention toward each random event,
						then the former study might result in an effect size orders of magnitude larger that the latter. (p. 529).”

				<h1>The Feedback</h1>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="large-12 columns">
					<p>
						The concept of 'feedback' is at the core of Biocentric Game, in a similar sense to neurobiofeedback or biofeedback.
						Biofeedback may be defined as follows:
						<blockquote>
							"Biofeedback is the process of gaining greater awareness of many physiological functions primarily using instruments that provide information on
							the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will.
							Some of the processes that can be controlled include brainwaves, muscle tone, skin conductance, heart rate and pain perception.
							Biofeedback may be used to improve health, performance, and the physiological changes that often occur in conjunction with changes
							to thoughts, emotions, and behaviour.
							Eventually, these changes may be maintained without the use of extra equipment, even though no equipment is necessarily required to practice biofeedback.
							…
							Claude Bernard proposed in 1865 that the body strives to maintain a steady state in the internal environment (milieu intérieur), introducing the concept of homeostasis.
							In 1885, J.R. Tarchanoff showed that voluntary control of heart rate could be fairly direct (cortical-autonomic) and did not depend on "cheating"
							by altering breathing rate. In 1901, J. H. Bair studied voluntary control of the retrahens aurem muscle that wiggles the ear, discovering that subjects
							learned this skill by inhibiting interfering muscles and demonstrating that skeletal muscles are self-regulated. Alexander Graham Bell attempted
							to teach the deaf to speak through the use of two devices — the phonautograph, created by Édouard-Léon Scott’s, and a manometric flame.
							The former translated sound vibrations into tracings on smoked glass to show their acoustic waveforms, while the latter allowed sound
							to be displayed as patterns of light. After World War II, mathematician Norbert Wiener developed cybernetic theory, that proposed that systems
							are controlled by monitoring their results. The participants at the landmark 1969 conference at the Surfrider Inn in Santa Monica coined the term biofeedback
							from Wiener's feedback. The conference resulted in the founding of the Bio-Feedback Research Society, which permitted normally isolated researchers to
							contact and collaborate with each other, as well as popularising the term “biofeedback.”
							The work of B.F. Skinner led researchers to apply operant conditioning to biofeedback, decide which responses could be voluntarily controlled and which could not.
							The effects of the perception of autonomic nervous system activity was initially explored by George Mandler's group in 1958.
							In 1965, Maia Lisina combined classical and operant conditioning to train subjects to change blood vessel diameter, eliciting and displaying reflexive
							blood flow changes to teach subjects how to voluntarily control the temperature of their skin. In 1974, H.D. Kimmel trained subjects to sweat using
							the galvanic skin response.”
							<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback</a> </cite>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
						It could be also relevant to note that (same source cited above):
						<blockquote>
							"Biofeedback systems have been known in India and some other countries for millennia.
							Ancient Hindu practices like Yoga and Pranayama (Breathing techniques)are essentially biofeedback methods.
							Many yogis and sadhus have been known to exercise control over their physiological processes.
							In addition to recent research on Yoga, Paul Brunton, the British writer who travelled extensively in India, has written about many cases he has witnessed.”
							<cite> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback</a> </cite>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h2>Neurofeedback</h2>
					<p>
						A definition of neurofeedback (or neurobiofeedback) is as follows:
						<blockquote>
							“Neurofeedback is a type of biofeedback that measures brain waves to produce a signal that can be used as feedback on brain activity to teach self-regulation.
							Neurofeedback is commonly provided using video or sound, with positive feedback for desired brain activity and negative feedback for brain activity that is undesirable.
							Some feel that the most accurate form of neurofeedback is the one guided by qEEG, that is usually used in clinical settings.
							But this approach, although being helpful, is being seen by many as more using a linear science that is not in tune with modern, non-linear physics.”

				<h1>Evalutating the Randomness</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="large-12 columns">
					<p>
						In Biocentric Game the methods for evaluating the randomness are directly inspired by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (NIST),
						In the publication the randomness is described as follows:
						<blockquote>
							"A random bit sequence could be interpreted as the result of the flips of an unbiased “fair” coin with sides that are labeled “0” and “1,” with each flip
							having a probability of exactly 1⁄2 of producing a “0” or “1.” Furthermore, the flips are independent of each other: the result of any previous coin
							flip does not affect future coin flips. The unbiased “fair” coin is thus the perfect random bit stream generator, since the “0” and “1” values will be
							randomly distributed (and [0,1] uniformly distributed). All elements of the sequence are generated independently of each other, and the value of the next
							element in the sequence cannot be predicted, regardless of how many elements have already been produced.
							Obviously, the use of unbiased coins for cryptographic purposes is impractical. Nonetheless, the hypothetical output of such an idealised generator
							of a true random sequence serves as a benchmark for the evaluation of random and pseudorandom number generators."
							<cite><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/index.html" target="_blank">Special Publication 800-22:
								“A Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators for Cryptographic Applications"</a> </cite>
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
						The NIST also makes available the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html" target="_blank">source code</a> of
						the algorithms described in the publication, and it has been incorporated in Biocentric Game.
						The tests performed on the sequence are:
						<h3 class="subheader">Frequency (Monobit) Test</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence.
							The purpose of this test is to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would be expected
							for a truly random sequence.
							The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to 1⁄∕2, that is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same.
							All subsequent tests depend on the passing of this test.”
						</blockquote>
						<h3 class="subheader">Frequency Test within a Block</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“The focus of the test is the proportion of ones within M-bit blocks. The purpose of this test is to determine whether the frequency of ones in an M-bit block
							is approximately M/2, as would be expected under an assumption of randomness.
							For block size M=1, this test degenerates to test 1, the Frequency (Monobit) test.”
						</blockquote>
						<h3 class="subheader">Runs Test</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence of identical bits.
							A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with a bit of the opposite value.
							The purpose of the runs test is to determine whether the number of runs of ones and zeros of various lengths is as expected for a random sequence.
							In particular, this test determines whether the oscillation between such zeros and ones is too fast or too slow.”
						</blockquote>
						<h3 class="subheader">Test for the Longest Run of Ones in a Block</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“The focus of the test is the longest run of ones within M-bit blocks.
							The purpose of this test is to determine whether the length of the longest run of ones within the tested sequence is consistent with the length
							of the longest run of ones that would be expected in a random sequence.
							Note that an irregularity in the expected length of the longest run of ones implies that there is also an irregularity
							in the expected length of the longest run of zeroes. Therefore, only a test for ones is necessary.”
						</blockquote>
						<h3 class="subheader">Approximate Entropy Test</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“... the focus of this test is the frequency of all possible overlapping m-bit patterns across the entire sequence.
							The purpose of the test is to compare the frequency of overlapping blocks of two consecutive/adjacent lengths (m and m+1)
							against the expected result for a random sequence.”
						</blockquote>
						<h3 class="subheader">Cumulative Sums (Cusum) Test</h3>
						<blockquote>
							“The focus of this test is the maximal excursion (from zero) of the random walk defined by the cumulative sum of adjusted (-1, +1) digits in the sequence.
							The purpose of the test is to determine whether the cumulative sum of the partial sequences occurring in the tested sequence is too large or
							too small relative to the expected behavior of that cumulative sum for random sequences.
							This cumulative sum may be considered as a random walk. For a random sequence, the excursions of the random walk should be near zero.
							For certain types of non-random sequences, the excursions of this random walk from zero will be large.”
