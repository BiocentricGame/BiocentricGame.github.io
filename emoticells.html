				<h2>Revising 'The Game of Life'</h2>
				<p>
					Biocentric Game is freely inspired to the Conway's Game of Life, the cellular automation devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
					This classic is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is only determined by an initial state, requiring no further input by the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Biocentric Game instead you have to manage some dynamic entities called Emoticells because they have a mood, and their mood depends by the state of the simulation, their world.
					In Biocentric Game the game state is influenced by the variations toward
					<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip [tip-top tip-bottom tip-left tip-right] [radius round]"
					title="It is the state of the game that denies to win, it is obtained when the entropy source
					(the random number generator) is providing sequences of numbers that are measured as being effectively random.">Chaos</span>
					or
					<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip [tip-top tip-bottom tip-left tip-right] [radius round]" title="It is the state of the game that permits to win,
					it is obtained when the entropy source (the random number generator) is providing sequences of numbers that are measured as non-random.">Coherence</span>
					.
					<br>
					During the simulation many sequences of RNG's data are acquired and analysed to determine, according to well known statistical principles, their effective grade of randomness or,
					on the contrary, their grade of
					<span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip [tip-top tip-bottom tip-left tip-right] [radius round]" title="It is the state of the game that permits to win,
					it is obtained when the entropy source (the random number generator) is providing sequences of numbers that are measured as non-random.">Coherence</span>
					(lack of randomness).
					<br>
					Because of that you will have two different situation: a 'Chaos' state that is determined by sequences of random data being measured really as random,
					and a second state named
					'Coherence'
					, this second state determined by the fact that the ‘expected’ random data are not actually random,
					according to the sets of measurements that are used.
				</p>

				<h4> The state of 'Chaos' determines many penalisation:</h4>
				<p>
					<ul class="disc">
						<li>
							Emoticells acquire nutrition slowly
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells die of overpopulation
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells can’t add to tissue (and you can never win)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>The state of 'Coherence' determines many advantages </h4>
				<p>
					that bring rapidly to a victory condition:
					<br>
					<ul class="disc">
						<li>
							Emoticells grow up and acquire nutrition rapidly
						</li>
						<li>
							there is no any problem of overpopulation
						</li>
						<li>
							Emoticells can form tissue and you can reach the victory!

					The dotted line, that appears of yellow colour during a coherence, represents the level above which the source is not anymore  providing randomness.
